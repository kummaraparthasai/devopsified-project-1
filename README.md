# 🧪 Step 1: Local Application Testing

As a DevOps Engineer, the first step is to verify that the application works correctly in the local environment before containerizing it.

# 🐳 Step 2: Dockerizing the Application

After confirming the app works locally, the application is containerized using Docker.

## 🔨 Build Docker Image

docker build -t go-web-app .

---

## 🏷️  Tag Docker Image

docker tag go-web-app partha491612/go-web-app:22020854951

## 📤 Push to Docker Hub

docker push partha491612/go-web-app:22020854951

# ☸️ Step 3: Deploying to Amazon EKS

The Kubernetes cluster was created using:

eksctl create cluster --name demo-cluster --region us-east-1

## 📦 Running Pods

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Pods are successfully running inside the cluster.

## 🌐 Kubernetes Services

```bash
kubectl get svc
```

Service exposes the application via NodePort / LoadBalancer.

# 📦 Step 4: Helm Chart Integration

Helm is used to manage Kubernetes manifests efficiently.

---

## 🔄 values.yaml Configuration

```yaml
image:
  repository: partha491612/go-web-app
  tag: "22020854951"
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

The Docker image tag is dynamically updated during CI pipeline execution.

# ⚙️ Step 5: CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

On every push to the `main` branch, the pipeline performs:

### 🔁 Pipeline Stages

1️⃣ Code Quality Check
2️⃣ Docker Build
3️⃣ Docker Push
4️⃣ Helm Chart Tag Update

---

## ✅ CI/CD Success

Pipeline executed successfully.

# 🔄 Step 6: GitOps Deployment using ArgoCD

ArgoCD continuously monitors the Git repository.

When Helm chart image tag changes:

- ArgoCD detects changes
- Syncs automatically
- Deploys updated version to EKS cluster

---

## 📊 ArgoCD Dashboard

- 💚 Application Health: Healthy
- 🔄 Sync Status: Synced
- ✔️ Last Sync: Successful

# 🌍 Step 7: Final Production Output

Application successfully deployed via:

```
EKS → Pods → Service → Load Balancer → Public URL
```
